# E-commerce Management System Backend Boilerplate

This project provides a complete backend boilerplate for building a production-ready e-commerce management system.

## Purpose
Provide a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase that implements core e-commerce features using Go Fiber and Clean Architecture.

## Problems Solved
- Reduces time to set up standardized backend architecture.
- Ensures consistency in project structure and coding patterns.
- Provides built-in support for database migrations, testing, and containerization.

## How It Works
- Exposes RESTful endpoints for products, orders, and user authentication.
- Implements Clean Architecture layers to separate concerns.
- Uses SQLC for type-safe database queries and golang-migrate for migrations.
- Integrates JWT-based authentication and middleware for secure access control.

## User Experience Goals
- Developers should be able to scaffold and extend core features without boilerplate overhead.
- New team members can quickly understand and navigate the codebase.
- The system should start in minutes with minimal configuration.
