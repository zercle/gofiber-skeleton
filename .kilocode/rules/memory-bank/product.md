# Product Description

## 1. Why This Project Exists

This project, the Go Fiber Backend Boilerplate, exists to solve the recurring problem of time-consuming and inconsistent initial setup for new backend services. Developers often spend significant time configuring architecture, selecting libraries, and establishing best practices before they can even begin writing business logic. This boilerplate eliminates that redundant effort by providing a pre-configured, production-ready foundation.

The core purpose is to **accelerate development** and **ensure high-quality standards** from day one.

## 2. Problems It Solves

-   **Slow Project Kick-offs**: Reduces the time required to start a new backend project from days to minutes.
-   **Inconsistent Architectures**: Prevents architectural drift between different services or teams by enforcing a standardized Clean Architecture.
-   **Maintenance Overhead**: Simplifies long-term maintenance by establishing clear patterns for code organization, dependency management, and testing.
-   **Scalability Concerns**: Built on a decoupled, modular architecture that is designed to scale as business requirements grow.
-   **Onboarding Friction**: New developers can get up to speed quickly by referencing a well-defined and documented structure.

## 3. How It Should Work & User Experience Goals

The boilerplate is designed to be a **"clone-and-go"** template. The ideal user experience is for a developer to clone the repository, run a few simple setup commands, and immediately start building features.

### Key User Experience Goals:

-   **Effortless Initialization**: The setup process should be simple, fast, and clearly documented.
-   **Developer-Friendly**: The architecture should feel intuitive to developers familiar with Clean Architecture and modern Go practices. Adding a new feature (or "domain") should follow a predictable, repeatable workflow.
-   **Extensible by Default**: The boilerplate should provide a solid foundation without being overly opinionated, allowing developers to easily add new tools or modify existing ones.
-   **Confidence Inspiring**: Integrated testing, linting, and CI workflows should give developers confidence that their code is robust and reliable.
-   **Self-Documenting**: The code structure, along with auto-generated API documentation, should make the system easy to understand and work with.
