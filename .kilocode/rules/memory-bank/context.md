# Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has just been initialized from the Go Fiber Backend Boilerplate. The memory bank has been created, and the foundational project structure is in place.

## Recent Changes

-   Initialized the project structure.
-   Generated the core memory bank files (`product.md`, `architecture.md`, `tech.md`, `context.md`).

## Next Steps

-   Review and verify the accuracy of the newly created memory bank files.
-   Begin development by adding the first business domain to the application, following the steps outlined in `architecture.md`.
