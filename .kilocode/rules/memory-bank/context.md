# Context

**Current Work Focus**  
Initializing the memory bank for the E-commerce backend boilerplate, starting with core documentation files.

**Recent Changes**  
- Created `brief.md` outlining project overview, structure, and MVP stories.  
- Created `product.md` detailing project purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.
- Updated `architecture.md` to enforce that the domain layer contains only models and interfaces.
- Updated `tech.md` to include guideline to use go generate for mocks instead of manual edits.

**Next Steps**  
1. Draft `context.md` to capture current focus and progression.  
2. Create `architecture.md` to document system architecture and key design decisions.  
3. Create `tech.md` to list technologies, setup instructions, dependencies, and constraints.  
4. Review all memory bank files with the user for accuracy.
