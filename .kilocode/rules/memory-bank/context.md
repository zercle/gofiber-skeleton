**Current Work Focus**

Project is now fully functional with clean modular architecture. All build errors have been resolved and comprehensive test coverage is in place.

**Recent Changes**

- Successfully refactored domain structure into separate modules: `productmodule`, `usermodule`, and `ordermodule`
- Fixed all undefined module references in repository, usecase, and handler files
- Fixed import issues across test files (unit and integration tests)
- Updated dependency injection configuration to support new module structure
- All tests are now passing (internal modules and integration tests)
- Code passes golangci-lint without issues
- Adjusted Go version to 1.23 for toolchain compatibility

**Next Steps**

1. Project is ready for development and deployment
2. All core CRUD operations for products, orders, and users are implemented and tested
3. Clean Architecture principles are properly enforced
4. Database migrations and SQLC code generation are configured correctly
