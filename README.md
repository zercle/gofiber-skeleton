## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Recommended for easiest setup)
*   [Go (1.24+)](https://golang.org/doc/install) (Required if running without Docker)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (Required if running without Docker)
*   [Valkey](https://valkey.io/docs/install/) (or Redis, required if running without Docker)

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the quickest way to get the service up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ecommerce-backend
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and modify it as needed.
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    Refer to the [Configuration](#-configuration) section for details on environment variables.

3.  **Start Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    This command builds the Docker images, sets up the PostgreSQL and Valkey containers, and starts the Go Fiber application.

4.  **Access the API:**
    Once all services are up, you can access:
    *   **API Server**: `http://localhost:8080`
    *   **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` (for interactive API documentation)

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the application directly on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ecommerce-backend
    ```

2.  **Install Go Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

3.  **Set up Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
    *   Create a new database for the application (e.g., `ecommerce_db`).
    *   Update your `.env` file with the correct database connection string.

4.  **Set up Caching (Valkey/Redis):**
    *   Ensure Valkey or Redis is installed and running.
    *   Update your `.env` file with the correct cache connection string.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and modify it according to your local setup.
    ```bash
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    Refer to the [Configuration](#-configuration) section for details.

6.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    make migrate-up
    ```
    This will apply all necessary database schemas.

7.  **Generate SQLC Code:**
    ```bash
    make sqlc-generate
    ```
    This generates Go code from your SQL queries.

8.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    Or, for hot-reloading during development:
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration, managed via `Viper`. A `example.env` file is provided as a template. Copy it to `.env` and adjust the values as needed.

Key environment variables:

*   `APP_PORT`: The port on which the Go Fiber application will listen (e.g., `8080`).
*   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for PostgreSQL (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable`).
*   `REDIS_ADDR`: Address for Valkey/Redis cache (e.g., `localhost:6379`).
*   `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication. **Change this to a strong, random value in production.**
*   `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: Expiration time for JWT tokens in minutes (e.g., `60`).

## üöÄ API Endpoints

The API provides comprehensive endpoints for e-commerce management. You can interact with it using tools like `curl`, Postman, or through the Swagger UI.

### üîê Authentication Endpoints

#### Register a New User
`POST /api/v1/users/register`
```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "strongpassword",
  "role": "customer"
}
```

#### Login User
`POST /api/v1/users/login`
```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "strongpassword"
}
```
*Response will include a `token` for subsequent authenticated requests.*

### üì¶ Product Management

All product management endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`).

#### Create a Product
`POST /api/v1/products`
```json
{
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "description": "A sample product description",
  "price": 29.99,
  "stock": 100,

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **"Port already in use" error**: If you're running locally and get this error, another process is likely using `APP_PORT` (default `8080`). Either change `APP_PORT` in your `.env` file or stop the conflicting process.
*   **Database connection issues**:
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible from your application.
    *   Check `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file for correct hostname, port, username, password, and database name.
    *   If running with Docker Compose, ensure the database service is healthy (`docker-compose ps`).
*   **Valkey/Redis connection issues**:
    *   Ensure Valkey/Redis is running and accessible.
    *   Check `REDIS_ADDR` in your `.env` file.
    *   If running with Docker Compose, ensure the cache service is healthy.
*   **`sqlc` or migration errors**: Ensure your `Makefile` commands are executed in the correct order (`sqlc-generate` before `run` or `dev` if schema changes).
*   **JWT token issues**: Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set and consistent between your application and any clients. Check token expiration times.
