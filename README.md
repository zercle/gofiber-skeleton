# E-commerce Management System Backend Boilerplate üõçÔ∏è

This project provides a backend boilerplate for an e-commerce management system, built with Go Fiber, golang-migrate (Postgres), SQLC, JWT, uber-go/mock, DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock, air, and Docker. It follows Clean Architecture and SOLID Principles for a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized using a Clean Architecture approach:

*   **`cmd/server`**: Application entry point.
*   **`internal/infrastructure`**: Holds external infrastructure code (e.g., email, cache, messaging).
*   **`internal/domain`**: Defines interfaces for communication between different layers.
*   **`internal/handler`**: Manages HTTP requests and responses.
*   **`internal/repository`**: Handles database interactions.
*   **`internal/usecase`**: Contains business logic and calls the repository.
*   **`pkg`**: Stores shared packages.
*   **`compose.yml`**: Manages Docker services.
*   **`Dockerfile`**: Builds the Docker image.
*   **`migrations`**: Manages database migrations.

## Authentication Flow

### Registering a New User

To register a new user, send a `POST` request to `/api/v1/register` with the user's credentials in the request body.

### Logging In and Retrieving a JWT

After registration (or for existing users), send a `POST` request to `/api/v1/login` with the user's credentials. If successful, the API will return a JSON Web Token (JWT). This token is essential for accessing protected routes.

### Including the JWT in Requests

For all protected API endpoints, you must include the retrieved JWT in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests. The format should be `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`.

Example:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjMsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiZXhhbXBsZXVzZXIifQ.signature
```

### Middleware Behavior and Protected Routes

The backend uses middleware to validate the JWT for all routes requiring authentication. If a request to a protected route does not include a valid JWT, the API will return an unauthorized error. Ensure your client-side application handles the storage and inclusion of this token for subsequent authenticated requests.
