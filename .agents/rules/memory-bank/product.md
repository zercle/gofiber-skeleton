# Product Vision & Goals

## Product Purpose

The Go Fiber Skeleton is a **production-ready backend template repository** designed to significantly accelerate the development of new Go backend services. It serves as a comprehensive "skeleton" project that eliminates boilerplate setup and provides established best practices out of the box.

## Problem Statement

### Developer Pain Points Addressed

1. **Boilerplate Overhead**: Developers spend significant time setting up project structure, configuration, database connections, authentication, and other foundational elements before writing business logic.

2. **Architecture Decisions**: Teams often struggle with implementing Clean Architecture correctly, leading to tightly coupled code that's difficult to maintain and test.

3. **Tooling Setup**: Configuring development tools, testing frameworks, documentation generation, and deployment pipelines is time-consuming and error-prone.

4. **Best Practices**: Ensuring consistent code quality, security practices, and performance optimizations across projects requires extensive experience and discipline.

5. **Onboarding Friction**: New team members need to understand project structure and patterns before becoming productive, slowing down development velocity.
