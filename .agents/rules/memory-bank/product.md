# Product Document: Go Fiber Microservice Template

## Problem Statement

**Core Problem:** Developers frequently need to create microservices but struggle with establishing a consistent, production-ready foundation that balances simplicity with enterprise requirements. Many templates are either overly complex (requiring extensive setup) or too simplistic (lacking essential production features).

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Inconsistent Architecture:** Teams often start with ad-hoc structures that don't scale well
2. **Missing Production Essentials:** Templates lack critical features like authentication, monitoring, and graceful shutdown
3. **Developer Experience Overhead:** Complex setup processes slow down initial development
4. **Poor Testing Infrastructure:** Inadequate mocking and testing patterns lead to low coverage
5. **Container Deployment Complexity:** Templates not optimized for modern container orchestration

## Solution Vision

A lightweight, opinionated microservice template that provides immediate value while maintaining flexibility for customization. The template should feel natural to Go developers while introducing modern best practices without overwhelming complexity.

## Target Audience & User Personas

### Primary Users
**Backend Developers & DevOps Engineers**
- Go language proficiency (intermediate to advanced)
- Building microservices or APIs
- Need production-ready foundations
- Value performance and simplicity
- Working in containerized environments

### Secondary Users
**Technical Leads & Architects**
- Establishing team standards
- Need consistent service templates
- Focus on maintainability and scalability
- Require comprehensive documentation

**Learning/Personal Projects**
- Developers learning microservice patterns
- Educational purposes
- Proof-of-concept development

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Immediate Productivity:** Template setup should take minutes, not hours
2. **Intuitive Structure:** Clear separation of concerns following standard Go conventions
3. **Zero-Confusion Deployment:** Docker-native with sensible defaults
4. **Self-Documenting Code:** Code should explain itself through clear patterns and comprehensive documentation

### Performance Goals
1. **Fast Startup:** Services should start quickly for development and scaling
2. **Low Memory Footprint:** Efficient resource utilization for microservice environments
3. **High Throughput:** Leverage Fiber's performance characteristics
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Handle failures gracefully without service disruption

### Developer Experience Goals
1. **Low Cognitive Load:** Simple, predictable patterns throughout the codebase
2. **Excellent Tooling:** Integrated linting, testing, and documentation generation
3. **Clear Errors:** Meaningful error messages with proper context
4. **Hot Reload:** Development workflow should support rapid iteration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Service startup time: < 2 seconds
- Memory usage: < 50MB base footprint
- Test coverage: > 80% across all layers
- Build time: < 30 seconds for container image
- API response time: < 100ms for simple endpoints

### Adoption Metrics
- Developer setup time: < 15 minutes from clone to running service
- Documentation completeness: All APIs documented with Swagger
- Code quality: 0 golangci-lint violations
- Template consistency: Standardized structure across team projects

## Key Differentiators

1. **Fiber Framework Choice:** Utilizes Fiber's Express.js-like API for developers familiar with Node.js patterns
2. **SQL-First Development:** Emphasizes SQL queries first, then generates Go code via sqlc
3. **Microservice-Specific:** Designed specifically for microservice patterns, not monolithic applications
4. **Container-Native:** Optimized from the ground up for container deployment
5. **Testing Infrastructure:** Comprehensive mocking and testing setup out of the box

## Non-Goals

1. **Monolithic Application Support:** Focus remains on microservice patterns
2. **Multiple Frameworks:** Opinionated about Fiber as the HTTP framework
3. **Legacy Database Support:** Modern database focus (no legacy system integration)
4. **UI Components:** Backend-only template (no frontend frameworks)
5. **Complex Authentication:** JWT/OIDC focus, no OAuth2 provider functionality

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- All code must pass golangci-lint v2 with strict rules
- Comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers
- Generated mocks for all interfaces via go:generate
- Swagger documentation for all HTTP endpoints

### Performance Standards
- Follow goperf.dev optimization patterns
- Implement connection pooling and resource management
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Memory-efficient implementations

### Security Standards
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Structured error handling without information leakage
- HTTPS enforcement for production deployments

## Future Roadmap Considerations

1. **Advanced Patterns:** Circuit breakers, distributed tracing, service mesh integration
2. **Multiple Database Support:** Enhanced support for different database types
3. **Event Streaming:** Integration patterns for event-driven architectures
4. **Advanced Authentication:** Multiple auth providers and token types
5. **Performance Optimization:** Advanced caching strategies and query optimization

This product document serves as the foundation for understanding the "why" behind technical decisions and ensuring the template meets user needs while maintaining focus on core objectives.
