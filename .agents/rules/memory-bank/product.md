# Product Vision

This repository delivers a production-ready Go backend template that accelerates delivery of multi-tenant community and knowledge platforms, enabling teams to launch modern, secure APIs in weeks instead of months.

## Target Users

- **Startup platform teams** needing a head start on forum, Q&A, or community engagement products.
- **Enterprise innovation squads** validating new knowledge-sharing experiences while meeting security and compliance standards.
- **Consultancies and solution partners** delivering repeatable foundations for B2B community portals or developer hubs.

## Core Value Proposition

1. **Opinionated yet extensible architecture** with clean domain boundaries and best-in-class tooling aligned to current industry practices.
2. **End-to-end experience** covering authentication, rich discussion threads, notifications, moderation, and analytics primitives out of the box.
3. **Operational excellence baked in** with observability, CI/CD, deployment manifests, and playbooks to achieve day-two readiness.
4. **Developer ergonomics** providing frictionless local setup, hot reload, comprehensive docs, and automated code generation pipelines.

## Product Goals

- Provide a minimal viable forum and knowledge base API with modular domains ready for specialization.
- Guarantee consistent DX across macOS, Linux, and Windows using containerized workflows and Taskfile automation.
- Offer batteries-included observability, security, and compliance guardrails for immediate SOC2/GDPR audit preparation.
- Demonstrate scalable extension patterns allowing teams to introduce new domains (e.g., polls, marketplaces) without architectural rewrites.

## Key Domains Delivered

| Domain | Outcomes |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication & Authorization | Passwordless login, MFA, JWT/PASETO tokens, role and policy management. |
| Forum Core | Threads, posts, comments, reactions, moderation queues, spam detection hooks. |
| Notifications | Multi-channel delivery (email, push, realtime), templating, and retry policies. |
| Administration | Tenant provisioning, feature flag governance, audit trails, data residency controls. |
| Analytics | Event ingestion, aggregation jobs, exposed KPIs for engagement and retention dashboards. |

## User Journeys

1. **Engineer onboarding**: clone repo → run `task dev:up` → access REST and gRPC playgrounds with seeded data within 5 minutes.
2. **Product iteration**: define new forum moderation rule → update domain logic and policy config → automated tests and contract docs regenerate via `task generate`.
3. **Operations launch**: pipeline merges trigger GitHub Actions → container images publish → Helm manifests apply to staging → metrics and logging appear automatically in Grafana.

## Success Metrics

- **Setup time**: <10 minutes from clone to serving authenticated API responses locally.
- **Test coverage**: 80%+ coverage across use cases and adapters by default scaffolding.
- **Deployment lead time**: <15 minutes from merge to production rollout using provided CI/CD pipeline.
- **Documentation completeness**: 100% of public endpoints described via OpenAPI and gRPC reflection out of the box.
- **Support load**: <5% of adopters requiring assistance to customize primary domains, measured via issue templates.

## Differentiators

- Uses Go 1.24+ features (generics v2, range-over-func) and Fiber v3 to stay current with ecosystem evolution.
- Includes async collaboration components (websocket/live updates) alongside REST and gRPC interfaces.
- Integrates resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retry budgets) and chaos testing hooks by default.
- Provides governance artifacts (architecture decision records, data handling matrix) to accelerate compliance reviews.

## Future Enhancements Roadmap

- Expand GraphQL gateway option backed by gqlgen for consumer-friendly schemas.
- Introduce AI-assisted moderation pipelines with configurable providers.
- Offer turnkey integrations with customer data platforms (Segment) and CRM systems (HubSpot, Salesforce).
