# Product Definition: Go Fiber Microservice Template

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Backend developers building Go microservices face a choice: start from scratch (reinventing common patterns) or adopt a heavy framework (adding unnecessary complexity). Either path introduces friction and potential inconsistencies.

**User Pain Points:**
1. Repetitive setup of layered architecture components across projects
2. Inconsistent error handling, logging, and configuration patterns
3. Uncertainty about best practices for security, testing, and code organization
4. Time wasted on boilerplate instead of business logic
5. Difficulty maintaining consistent code quality across team projects
6. Lack of clear examples for common patterns (JWT auth, database transactions, etc.)

## Target Users & Personas

### Primary Persona: Backend Developer (Startup/Scale-up)
- **Profile:** Mid-level Go engineer at a growing company
- **Goals:** Ship features quickly without compromising code quality
- **Pain Points:**
  - Needs consistency across multiple microservices
  - Must balance speed-to-market with maintainability
  - Limited time for architecture design
- **Success Metrics:** Can clone template and start building business logic in <15 minutes

### Secondary Persona: Tech Lead/Architect
- **Profile:** Senior engineer establishing engineering standards
- **Goals:** Set team standards, reduce code review friction, ensure security
- **Pain Points:**
  - Multiple implementations of the same patterns across team
  - Difficulty enforcing code quality standards
  - Need to document architecture decisions
- **Success Metrics:** Team can reference single template for consistency, clear ADRs guide decisions

### Tertiary Persona: Learner/Junior Developer
- **Profile:** Early-career engineer learning Go/microservices
- **Goals:** Understand industry-standard patterns and best practices
- **Pain Points:**
  - Overwhelmed by too many choices
  - Unclear which patterns are essential vs. optional
  - Need clear examples with explanations
- **Success Metrics:** Can understand and extend template, learns testing/DI patterns

## User Experience Goals

### Onboarding Experience
- **Zero Friction Setup:** Clone, run `make` commands, start coding
- **Clear Navigation:** Obvious where to add handlers, usecases, repositories
- **Learning by Example:** Example implementation guides new developers
- **Runnable State:** Template is immediately runnable (even if minimal)

### Development Workflow
- **Quick Iteration:** Add new endpoints without architectural decisions
- **Type Safety:** Compiler catches errors early (sqlc, interfaces)
- **Clear Contracts:** Handlers → Usecases → Repositories define clear boundaries
- **Testing Built-in:** Mock generation and database mocking setup ready to use
- **Code Quality:** Linting errors caught immediately, not in PR review

### Production Readiness
- **Observable:** Structured logging and health checks built-in
- **Secure:** Auth, rate limiting, input validation examples included
- **Scalable:** Stateless design supports horizontal scaling
- **Deployable:** Docker and graceful shutdown patterns ready
- **Maintainable:** Clear structure makes onboarding new team members fast

## Value Proposition

### Time Savings
- **Development:** Skip architecture design phase (weeks → hours)
- **Testing:** Mock generation and fixtures already configured
- **Deployment:** Dockerfile and graceful shutdown patterns ready
- **Onboarding:** New team members understand structure immediately

### Quality Improvements
- **Consistency:** All services follow same patterns
- **Type Safety:** sqlc + interface-driven design catch errors at compile-time
- **Testing:** High coverage encouraged by structure
- **Security:** Best practices baked into patterns (rate limiting, input validation)

### Business Value
- **Faster Feature Delivery:** Engineers spend time on business logic, not infrastructure
- **Reduced Risk:** Proven patterns reduce architectural mistakes
- **Lower Maintenance:** Consistent patterns reduce code review friction
- **Team Growth:** Clear structure accelerates onboarding of new developers

## Success Criteria

### Template Adoption Success
1. **Usability:** Developers can add new endpoints following pattern without guidance
2. **Quality:** Generated code passes golangci-lint v2 with zero errors
3. **Documentation:** Architecture decisions documented in ADRs
4. **Performance:** Template meets Fiber performance characteristics
5. **Security:** Authentication, rate limiting, input validation working by default

### Developer Satisfaction
1. **Ease of Use:** <2 hours to create first custom endpoint
2. **Understanding:** Developers can explain layered architecture choice
3. **Extensibility:** Can add features (new DB drivers, auth methods) without breaking core
4. **Testing:** Comfortable writing tests using provided mocking patterns

## Key Differentiators

| Aspect | Template-Go-Fiber | Generic Boilerplate | Heavy Framework |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **Setup Time** | <5 minutes | 15-30 minutes | Varies widely |
| **Code Clarity** | Clean, obvious | Can be opaque | Feature-rich, complex |
| **Performance** | Fiber's speed | Varies | Can be bloated |
| **Learning Curve** | Minimal | Moderate | Steep |
| **Flexibility** | High | Moderate | Limited |
| **Out-of-box Features** | Essential only | More complete | Everything included |
| **Code Review** | Quick (patterns) | Lengthy | Long (more code) |

## Non-Goals

1. **Framework Replacement:** Not attempting to replace specialized frameworks
2. **One-size-fits-all:** Assumes RESTful microservice pattern, not all service types
3. **Heavy Abstraction:** Values clarity over maximum DRY principle
4. **Built-in Persistence:** Expects developers to design own domain models
5. **Infrastructure as Code:** Focus is application layer, not infra provisioning
