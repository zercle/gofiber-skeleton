# Current Context

- Repository re-envisioned as a modern Go 1.24+ Fiber v3 backend template following domain-driven clean architecture with modular adapters and ports.
- Core documentation established:
  - [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) describes layered system topology, domain modules, persistence strategy, observability, security, and deployment patterns.
  - [`product.md`](product.md) outlines target users, value proposition, domain outcomes, user journeys, success metrics, differentiators, and roadmap.
  - [`tech.md`](tech.md) enumerates sanctioned tooling across runtime, libraries, data stores, observability, DevEx, testing, CI/CD, IaC, and compliance practices.
- Memory bank initialization intentionally ignores existing implementation, treating docs as authoritative specification for future development.

## Recent Changes

- Authored new architecture blueprint aligning with modern stack vision.
- Captured product goals and differentiators for community/knowledge platforms.
- Documented comprehensive technology stack encompassing development through production operations.

## Next Steps

1. Align repository structure and code generation scripts with documented architecture (cmd/core/app/ports/adapters layout, Taskfile orchestration).
2. Implement scaffolding for primary domains (auth, forum, notifications, admin, analytics) consistent with specification.
3. Provision infrastructure automation (Helmfile, Terraform modules, Tilt/Taskfile) to match defined environments.
4. Integrate CI/CD workflows, observability stack, and security guardrails per tech blueprint.

## Open Questions / Risks

- Need confirmation on preferred DI framework (Uber Fx vs Wire) and whether both should be supported.
- Decide on default messaging backend (NATS JetStream vs Kafka) if organizational constraints differ.
- Determine compliance baselines (SOC2, ISO27001) to finalize audit logging and data residency policies.
- Clarify priority between gRPC and GraphQL gateways for initial release.
