# Current Context

- Current development focus: refactoring to a simplified, SOLID-friendly package layout; implementing new internal/platform, internal/domains/<domain>/api, /biz, and /store modules and updating existing code accordingly.
- Recent updates: introduced new directories for platform bootstrap, shared DI modules, and updated README to reflect the simplified layout.
- Next actionable steps:
  1. Complete migration of domain modules to the new structure.
  2. Update DI modules and server bootstrap in internal/platform.
  3. Adjust import paths and update tests to reflect the new structure.
  4. Update Memory Bank architecture.md to document the new system architecture.
