# **Context Documentation: Go Fiber Skeleton**

## **1. Current Project State**

### **Project Phase: Post-Refactoring / Reset**
The project has undergone a significant **refactoring/simplification** process where the complete project structure and dependencies were removed. This represents a **reset to foundation** state, leaving only the core Go module and agent configuration systems.

**Current Status**: Foundation-only state requiring full re-implementation
**Branch**: `refactore/simplify-code`
**Recent Activity**: Major structural simplification and dependency removal

### **Current Working Directory State**
- **Total Files**: 7 core files
- **Code Files**: Only `go.mod` remains
- **Configuration**: Multiple agent configuration files present
- **Architecture**: Intended Clean Architecture but not implemented
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies currently defined

## **2. Recent Changes and Impact**

### **Latest Commits Analysis**
1. **`a435dd5`** - "refactor: remove complete project structure and dependencies"
   - **Impact**: Complete architectural reset
   - **Scope**: Removed domains, infrastructure, implementations
   - **Reason**: Simplification/cleanup effort

2. **`d28986a`** - Memory bank status update
3. **`c9f7329`** - Previous API domain implementation (now removed)
4. **`8b01244`** - Previous SQLC architecture (now removed)
5. **`2f84ed3`** - Previous transaction management (now removed)

### **Current Development Context**
- **Last Major Action**: Complete codebase simplification
- **Available Components**: Go module foundation + agent configs
- **Missing Components**: All domain implementations, infrastructure layers
- **Git Status**: Clean working directory on refactor branch

## **3. Current Focus Areas**

### **Immediate Priority: Architecture Re-establishment**
The project needs to rebuild the foundation architecture from the existing template specifications. The current focus should be on:

1. **Core Package Structure**: Recreate `internal/`, `cmd/`, `db/` directories
2. **Foundation Dependencies**: Re-add essential Go dependencies
3. **Configuration System**: Implement Viper-based configuration
4. **Web Framework**: Set up Fiber v2 with basic routing
5. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL + sqlc setup

### **Active Development Area: Memory Bank Implementation**
- **Current Task**: Initializing Memory Bank system
- **Status**: In Progress - Creating core documentation files
- **Purpose**: Re-establish project context and development guidance
- **Next Step**: Complete all Memory Bank files and validation

## **4. Immediate Next Steps**

### **Priority 1: Complete Memory Bank Setup**
- [ ] Generate remaining Memory Bank files (tech.md, product.md, tasks.md)
- [ ] Validate Memory Bank content with user
- [ ] Activate Memory Bank for development guidance

### **Priority 2: Core Architecture Foundation**
- [ ] Create basic directory structure (`internal/`, `cmd/`, `db/`)
- [ ] Update `go.mod` with essential dependencies
- [ ] Implement basic configuration management
- [ ] Set up minimal Fiber server with health check

### **Priority 3: Reference Implementation**
- [ ] Implement user domain as reference
- [ ] Set up database migrations
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Create basic testing framework

## **5. Blockers and Dependencies**

### **Current Blockers**
- **Architecture Decision**: Confirm template approach vs. custom implementation
- **Dependency Scope**: Determine which dependencies to re-add first
- **Development Direction**: Clarify next development priorities

### **Dependencies for Progress**
- **User Confirmation**: Memory Bank validation and direction confirmation
- **Architecture Decision**: Finalize implementation approach
- **Development Environment**: Set up local development environment

## **6. Development Environment Status**

### **Current Environment**
- **Go Version**: 1.25.0 (specified in go.mod)
- **Working Directory**: `/mnt/d/Works/zercle/gofiber-skeleton`
- **Git Branch**: `refactore/simplify-code`
- **Platform**: Linux (WSL2 environment)

### **Missing Development Tools**
- **No Docker Compose**: Development environment setup needed
- **No Makefile**: Development task automation missing
- **No Air**: Hot reload configuration not present
- **No Database**: PostgreSQL setup required

## **7. Technical Debt and Technical Items**

### **Technical Debt from Refactoring**
- **Removed Dependencies**: Need to re-add carefully based on actual needs
- **Missing Tests**: Testing infrastructure completely removed
- **Documentation**: API docs and implementation docs removed
- **Development Workflow**: Makefile and scripts removed

### **Architecture Decisions Needed**
- **Feature Scope**: Determine initial feature set for re-implementation
- **Domain Priority**: Which domains to implement first
- **Testing Strategy**: Establish testing approach and coverage goals
- **Deployment Target**: Confirm deployment and containerization needs

## **8. Session-Specific Notes**

### **Current Session Focus**
- **Primary Goal**: Initialize Memory Bank for project guidance
- **Secondary Goal**: Establish current state assessment
- **Method**: Template-driven approach based on brief.md specifications

### **Key Discoveries**
- **Template Foundation**: Strong template specifications exist in brief.md
- **Complete Reset**: Project has been simplified to absolute minimum
- **Agent Infrastructure**: Multiple agent configuration systems present
- **Architecture Clarity**: Clear intended architecture from documentation

### **User Interaction Patterns**
- **Template-Driven**: User prefers template-based approach
- **Memory Bank Oriented**: User values context preservation
- **Architecture-Focused**: User wants Clean Architecture implementation

## **9. Risk Assessment**

### **High Risk Items**
- **Architecture Drift**: Risk of deviating from template specifications
- **Dependency Bloat**: Risk of re-adding unnecessary dependencies
- **Implementation Complexity**: Risk of over-engineering in re-implementation

### **Medium Risk Items**
- **Development Delays**: Risk of extended setup time
- **Feature Scope Creep**: Risk of expanding scope too quickly
- **Testing Gaps**: Risk of insufficient testing coverage

### **Low Risk Items**
- **Tooling Setup**: Development environment tools are standard
- **Documentation**: Template documentation is comprehensive
- **Go Expertise**: Go ecosystem is well-established

## **10. Success Metrics for Current Phase**

### **Immediate Success Criteria**
- [ ] Memory Bank fully operational with all core files
- [ ] Basic project structure re-established
- [ ] Essential dependencies added and tested
- [ ] Development environment functional

### **Short-term Success Criteria (1-2 weeks)**
- [ ] Reference domain implementation complete
