# Context

## Current Work Focus

✅ **COMPLETE** - Fully implemented Go Fiber backend boilerplate matching ALL brief.md expectations.

## Recent Accomplishments

Successfully implemented a production-ready Go Fiber backend boilerplate with complete coverage of brief.md specifications:

### Core Architecture ✅
- **Clean Architecture** with proper domain separation (user example)
- **SOLID Principles** applied throughout the codebase
- **Domain-Driven Design** with clear layer boundaries

### Technology Stack ✅
- **Go Fiber** web framework with comprehensive middleware
- **PostgreSQL** database with migration system
- **SQLC** for type-safe database queries
- **samber/do** dependency injection container
- **Viper** configuration management with YAML files
- **gofiber/swagger** OpenAPI documentation
- **uber-go/mock** testing infrastructure with generated mocks

### Development Environment ✅
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **Air** configuration for hot reloading
- **golangci-lint** configuration for code quality
- **Comprehensive Makefile** with all commands from brief.md

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- **Generated mocks** with uber-go/mock for all interfaces
- **Unit tests** for handlers and use cases with proper isolation
- **Testify** integration for better assertions
- **Test coverage** reporting capabilities
- **Race condition detection** in test runs

### Production Readiness ✅
- **Environment-based configuration** (development/production)
- **Structured logging** and error handling
- **Health check endpoint** with database monitoring  
- **Proper request validation** and error responses
- **CORS and security middleware**

## Verification

- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ All tests pass with race detection
- ✅ Mock generation works correctly
- ✅ Dependency injection container functions properly
- ✅ Configuration management supports multiple environments
- ✅ API documentation accessible via Swagger UI

## Next Steps

The boilerplate is now ready for:
1. **Adding new domains** following the established patterns
2. **Production deployment** with the provided Docker configuration
3. **Team development** with comprehensive tooling and documentation
