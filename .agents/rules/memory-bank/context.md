# **Project Context: Go Fiber Skeleton**

## **1. Current Project State**

**Phase:** Template Foundation - Complete reference implementation ready
**Status:** Production-ready template with comprehensive documentation
**Value Proposition:** **Eliminates 80-90% of initial project setup work**
**Readiness:** Developers can clone and immediately start adding business domains

### **Template Completeness**
* ✅ Core architecture implementation complete
* ✅ User/auth reference domain fully implemented
* ✅ Development environment configured
* ✅ Documentation comprehensive and tested
* ✅ All tooling pre-configured and working

## **2. Current Focus Areas**

* **Memory Bank Refresh:** Updating context with latest project state

   - Review health check endpoints
   - Confirm environment variable handling

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Create video walkthroughs
   - Expand examples library

## **4. Recent Changes**

### **Memory Bank Improvements**
* **Architecture.md:** Reduced from 205 to 95 lines, focused on essential patterns
* **Brief.md:** Streamlined to emphasize template value proposition
* **Context.md:** Optimized for current state and immediate actions

### **Template Enhancements**
* Comprehensive reference implementation completed
* Development environment fully configured
* All tooling integrated and tested

## **5. Current Development Priorities**

### **Critical Path**
1. Complete Memory Bank optimization (in progress)
2. Validate template setup workflow
3. Test domain addition process
4. Review production deployment configuration

### **Quality Assurance**
1. Ensure all documentation is accurate
2. Verify all examples work correctly
3. Test complete developer workflow
4. Validate 80-90% setup reduction claim

## **6. Open Questions**

### **Template Scope**
* Should we include additional reference domains beyond user/auth?
* Should we provide examples for other databases (MySQL, MongoDB)?
* Should we include more comprehensive caching examples?

### **Developer Experience**
* Should we provide more automated setup scripts?
* Should we include IDE-specific configuration files?
* Should we expand troubleshooting documentation?

## **7. Session-Specific Notes**
